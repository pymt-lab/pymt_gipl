name: GIPL
summary: |
  GIPL (Geophysical Institute Permafrost Laboratory) is an implicit
  finite difference one-dimensional heat flow numerical model. The
  model uses a fine vertical resolution grid which preserves the
  latent-heat effects in the phase transition zone, even under
  conditions of rapid or abrupt changes in the temperature fields. It
  includes upper boundary condition (usually air temperature),
  constant geothermal heat flux at the lower boundary (typically from
  500 to 1000 m) and initial temperature distribution with depth. The
  other inputs are precipitation, prescribed water content and thermal
  properties of the multilayered soil column. As an output the model
  produces temperature distributions at different depths, active layer
  thickness and calculates time of freeze up. The results include
  temperatures at different depths and active layer thickness,
  freeze-up days.
